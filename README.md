## Implementation Details

The HTML page consists of two main sections: the left panel and the content area.

### Left Panel

The left panel is implemented using a `<div>` element with the class `left-panel`. It is styled to occupy 20% of the viewport width and has a background color of `#f2f2f2`. Inside this panel, there are four clickable components: Home, Contact, Information, and Guide.

### Content Area

The content area is implemented using a `<div>` element with the class `content`. It occupies the remaining 80% of the viewport width and initially displays the Home content.

When a component in the left panel is clicked, the content area updates to display the corresponding content. The content for each component can be customized by modifying the JavaScript code in the `index.html` file.
